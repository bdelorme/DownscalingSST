# HR_CNN
Downscaling Oceanographic Data with Convolutional Neural Networks

Make sure you have all the dependencies and source the toolbox with:
pip install -e .

This code uses Keras to build a Super Resolution Convolutionnal Neural Network (SRCNN).

I modified the code of this repertory: https://github.com/qobilidop/srcnn (here, I am applying SRCNN to oceanographic field).

Run the code with: python run.py myexp.json

See my report for more precision.
